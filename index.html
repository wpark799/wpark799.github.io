		<h1>My Biography</h1>
		<img src="myPicture.jpg" style="width:300px;height:300px;" </img>
		<p> My name is William Parker, and I am currently a freshman accounting major at Bob Jones University. I chose to major in accounting because of the many opportunities that you have. My dad is also an accountant and my mom is a math teacher, so I have always been good with numbers and general book keeping. I will also be looking into taking some coaching courses because I am very interested in becoming a basketball coach.</p>
		<p> I was born with a congenital heart defect, and have had many surgeries because of it. While in hospitals, I fell in love with sports as they gave me a way to pass the time, and I just loved to watch them. I love pretty much every sport, but my favorite is basketball. Although I was never able to play them because of the severity of the defect, I have always found a way to get involved with my high school sports teams. One of these ways was doing stats, which is another reason I feel like I am a good fit for accounting. While doing stats, I started to fall in love with coaching, and that has led me to where I am today.</p>
